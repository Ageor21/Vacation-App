So this application is titled  “Vacation app”. The purpose of this app is to schedule vacations where you can add trip name, hotel, date and excursions that you will attend during the vacation. I want users to have an easy time using the application, so my goal in mind was to keep the app navigation and usability simple. 

First on the home screen, you press “enter” to get to the main screen. This screen is empty until you populate the app with vacations. If you press the button in the bottom right corner it will take you to where you can schedule your vacation. Here you can enter the trip’s name, hotel you are staying at, you can enter both your start and end date. You have to click near the dates in order to make the textview appear where you can select a date. On the three dots in the top left corner, you can save the vacation once you feel out all parts. You can delete your vacation, this button should only be used once you select your vacation on the previous screen to delete. You can share your vacation through the different sms options. It will  automatically populate your vacation info (if you filled it out already) for you.You can notify the start of a vacation if you selected the day first then press “notify start”, same for notify end, you will select a date for the end date then you would click”notify end”. On the next screen, you can create excursions. You can add an excursion name and date. Also you can see a number list of vacations already set. You can save an excursion, which will appear on the previous screen,  you can delete it as well, and you can set a notification for excursions as well. Select a date and then press “notification”. Now, once you return to the “List of Vacations ” screen, you will see your vacation has populated. Once you click on it. You can edit or delete the vacation if you want. If you click on the button in the bottom corner again where you create excursions at, you can finally add excursions for that specific vacation. If you do this. You can delete the vacation because of the associated excursion. You will have to delete the excursion first before you can delete the vacation. You can add as many vacations and excursions as you desire.
